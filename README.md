## Project Description: 
Starving Artist community app:
This app will help registered customers find and hire new m
*musicians, 
*photographers, 
*artists 
for weddings, company events, & parties. 

Registered users can connect to each other to form a band together. 
Registered customers can search for freelance vendors, create event requests, 
and hire vendors for gigs related to their particular skills. 

## MVP: 
Our site will provide service to two types of users: artists and clients. Artists will be able to create profiles that display their skills and sample portfolio. Clients will be able to create event requests (event, date, location, price, etc.) that the artists can apply/bid for.

## Initial User Stories: 
1. As a classically trained musician with a PhD from Juilliard, I’m tired of living on ramen and Wonder Bread.  
I want a better way to find performance opportunities than Craigslist ads from clients in gimp and fur suits.


2. So my daughter wants to get married. Next week. She can’t wait. 
I need a way to find put some kind of ceremony together and fast in order to pre-empt an elopement. 
Naturally, that means music of some kind, and I’d prefer something live to add a modicum of class to this debacle.

3. Yoyoyo, name’s DJ L337 H@x0r 420, the illest upcoming  musician since Gucci mane. 
I need a way to share my m@D muzik sk1llz with the world and get paid to boot. 
Can’t start buying lambos without making that cheddar, can I? 
P.S. D.M. me for a mixtape. S**t’s fire, yo.
